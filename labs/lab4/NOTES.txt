Ben and Alex back at it again

Project Requirements:
-- Variable duty cycle from 1% to 100% in increments <1%
-- Duty cycle must always have a frequency of 40kHz
-- RPG input controlling the duty cycle percentage
-- Program must monitor fan speed and have output dependent on the speed
-- You must be able to toggle between modes by pressing a button (software debounced)
-- LCD must show the Duty cycle and Mode status at all times


Registers:
-- 16 -> current_state -> RPG input 
-- 17 -> previous_state -> RPG input
-- 18 -> duty_reg -> Control Duty Cycle
-- 19 -> data_reg -> used to load lcd nibble by nibble 



TODOs:
-> Use an interrupt service routine to measure the button push 
--- Software debounce

-> Logic for the modes of the LCD
--- Different modes
---- change register value for threshold based on mode
---- we need a register to track which mode we are in 

-> Sampling tacrometer signal
--- interpert the signal
--- display signal


-> fix duty cycle
--- we need to get from 1% to 100% 
--- we need to have a frequency of 40kHz

-> LED needs to go off when under mode threshold
