* We realized while investigating the camera of our initial proposal that the 
memory required to receive data was much much higher than expected, and had 
concerns of adding extra data while implementing Bluetooth. Below is a new more 
detailed proposal, on an idea that we're more invested in. *

Product:
A morse code transmitter and reciever pair, with LCD output and wireless bluetooth
connection. 

Functionality:
On one of two Atmega88PA boards, the user will input morse code characters
into a debounced button, which will then be interperated as an ASCII value. 
The characters will then be transmitted over bluetooth to the listening Atmega88PA
board. This listening board will then display the recieved ASCII data as it's
recieved onto the LCD Display.
