asumming none of these int variables overflow: 
  (scale the timer, make them floats, reset to 0 on word completion should 
  avoid going over)

// initial
int[6] inputs = [0,0,0,0,0,0] // 0: nothing 1: short 2: long
float downLength = 0
float upLength = 0

bool prevState = false

*timer always running, every tick triggers an interrupt (overflow not important)
that interrupt:
  boolean buttonDown = buttonDown()
  boolean buttonUp = !buttonDown

  if buttonDown // User still holding down the button
    downLength++

  if buttonUp // User not holding down the button
    upLength++

  // Cases:
  if posEdge: (Button was *just* released)
    if downLength >= 3units:
      add a long to inputs
    else if downLength >= 1unit:
      add a short to inputs

  if negEdge:
    if posLenth >= 3units:
      // determine ascii character from inputs

  if upLength >= 7units:
    // Word Case
    printSpace();
  
  prevState = buttonDown()

wordComplete():
  resets inputs = [0,0,0,0,0,0]
  sends space character
